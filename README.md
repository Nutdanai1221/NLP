### 1. Graph Transformer Networks (NeurIPS, 2019)
|Problems| Limitation of existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in handling heterogeneous graphs  |
|:------:|:-----|
|Related work| __1. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)__ are machine learning models developed to perform various tasks on graphs. There are two approaches, spectral and non-spectral.<br> __2. Node classification with GNNs__ is used to predict a label for each node in a graph based on its structure and features  |
|Solution| Author porpose a new framework call Graph Transformer Networks(GTNs). The GTNs are designed to transform heterogeneous graphs into meta-path graphs, which are paths connecting different types of edges. The GTNs learn to generate these meta-path graphs and node representations |
|Result|Author compares the performance of different Graph Neural Network (GNN) models for node classification in heterogeneous graphs. The models compared are GCN, GAT, HAN, and the proposed GTN model with public 3 datasets are DBLP, ACM, IMDB. The results show that the GNN-based methods perform better than random walk-based network embedding methods.|
### 2. Comparing word2vec and GloVe for Automatic Measurement of MWE Compositionality (ACL, 2020)
|Problems|The authors aim to compare the effectiveness of two popular embedding methods, GloVe and word2vec, for automatic measurement of the semantic compositionality of multiword expressions task and to explore the suitability of different resources for compositionality assessment. The ultimate goal is to improve the automatic identification and processing of MWEs, which are important but challenging for natural language processing.|

|Related work| __1. Multiword expressions (MWEs)__ are phrases or expressions that contain more than one word and have a specific meaning that is not straightforward from the meanings of the specific words such as "Let the Cat Out of the Bag" (meaning reveal the secret). <br>__2. Semantic compositionality__ refers to how well the meaning of a phrase can be understood by looking at the meanings of the words it is made up of. If a phrase is compositional, like 'Picnic Basket', its meaning can be easily understood by knowing what 'picnic' and 'basket' mean. But if a phrase is non-compositional, like 'Spill the Beans', you need more context to understand its meaning because it's not clear just from looking at the individual words. |
|Solution| The authors select multiword expression candidates from two different corpora, sort them into batches, and evaluate them using word embeddings to measure their compositionality. They use two popular word embedding models, GloVe and word2vec, to compare their performance. |
|Result| the authors compare the performance of two word embedding models, GloVe and word2vec, for evaluating the compositionality of multiword expressions (MWEs). They found that the word2vec model had higher correlation with compositionality scores than the GloVe model, and thus, they preferred it for future work. |
