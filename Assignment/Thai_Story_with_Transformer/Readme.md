# Thai Story Generator with Transformer
### This website is used to generate stories by using a dataset of [Thaisum](https://huggingface.co/datasets/thaisum).
### This project is using the tokenizer from [PyThaiNLP](https://pythainlp.github.io/projects/). After tokenizing the data, it will look like this: 'ผม', 'ไป', 'กิน', 'ข้าว'.
### This is reversion of thai story generator but using only decoder part to predict next word.
* My website is used to generate continuing stories. To get started, simply enter some words into the input box.<br> <br>
