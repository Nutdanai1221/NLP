### A Fast and Accurate Dependency Parser using Neural Networks (EMNLP, 2014)
|Problems| Traditional dependency parsing methods are often slow and not very accurate, leading to a need for a more efficient and effective approach. |
|:------:|:-----|
|Related work| 1. Dependency Parsing : A task in natural language processing to identify the relationships between words in a sentence. <br> 2. Neural Networks: The approach used to model the dependency parser, specifically feedforward and recurrent neural networks.  |
|Solution| The author represent all words, POS tags, and arc labels as dense vectors, and modeling their interactions through a new activation function called a "cube activation function." |
|Result|Parser that presented in the paper outperforms other greedy parsers in both accuracy and speed.|
