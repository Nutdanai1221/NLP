# Thai Story Generator with Pre-trained Model
### This website is used to generate stories by using GPT2 pre-trained from [flax-community/gpt2-base-thai](https://huggingface.co/flax-community/gpt2-base-thai) <br>and the datasets from  [Thaisum](https://huggingface.co/datasets/thaisum) .

* My website is used to generate continuing stories. To get started, simply enter some words into the input box.<br> <br>
