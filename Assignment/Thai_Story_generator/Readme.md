# Thai Story Generator
### This website is used to generate stories by using a dataset of Thaisum. [Link is here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/thaisum)
### This project is using the tokenizer from ThaiNLP. [Link](https://pythainlp.github.io/projects/) After tokenizing the data, it will look like this: 'ผม', 'รัก', 'คุณ'.
* My website is used to generate continuing stories. To get started, simply enter some words into the input box.<br> <br>
